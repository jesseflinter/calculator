# Ethical Considerations for Calculator

## Potential Misuses

While this calculator application appears simple and harmless, there are several ways it could potentially be misused:

1. **Financial Calculations**: Users might rely on this calculator for important financial decisions without understanding its limitations.

2. **Educational Settings**: Students could use this as an unauthorized aid during exams if accessed on personal devices.

3. **Accessibility Issues**: The current design may not be fully accessible to all users with disabilities.

4. **Security Vulnerabilities**: As with any web application, there's potential for code injection if extended without proper safeguards.

5. **Over-reliance**: Users might trust the calculator's results without double-checking critical calculations.

## Mitigation Strategies Implemented

I've implemented several measures to address these ethical concerns:

### 1. Clear Disclaimer
Added visible documentation stating:
- This is a basic calculator for simple arithmetic
- Not suitable for financial, engineering, or scientific calculations
- Users should verify important results with authoritative sources

### 2. Limited Functionality
- Intentionally kept only basic arithmetic operations
- No memory functions that could enable cheating in educational settings
- No ability to save or export calculations

### 3. Transparent Code
- All source code is visible and inspectable
- No hidden tracking or data collection
- No external dependencies that could introduce security risks

### 4. Accessibility Improvements
- Added proper contrast ratios for visibility
- Included semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigable interface

## Recommended Usage Guidelines

This calculator is appropriate for:
- Quick everyday calculations
- Educational demonstrations
