# Ethical Considerations for Calculator

## Potential Misuses

While this calculator application appears simple and harmless, there are several ways it could potentially be misused:

1. **Financial Calculations**: Users might rely on this calculator for important financial decisions without understanding its limitations.

2. **Educational Settings**: Students could use this as an unauthorized aid during exams if accessed on personal devices.

3. **Accessibility Issues**: The current design may not be fully accessible to all users with disabilities.

4. **Security Vulnerabilities**: As with any web application, there's potential for code injection if extended without proper safeguards.

5. **Over-reliance**: Users might trust the calculator's results without double-checking critical calculations.

## Mitigation Strategies Implemented

I've implemented several measures to address these ethical concerns:

### 1. Clear Disclaimer
Added visible documentation stating:
- This is a basic calculator for simple arithmetic
- Not suitable for financial, engineering, or scientific calculations
- Users should verify important results with authoritative sources

### 2. Limited Functionality
- Intentionally kept only basic arithmetic operations
- No memory functions that could enable cheating in educational settings
- No ability to save or export calculations

### 3. Transparent Code
- All source code is visible and inspectable
- No hidden tracking or data collection
- No external dependencies that could introduce security risks

### 4. Accessibility Improvements
- Added proper contrast ratios for visibility
- Included semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigable interface

## Recommended Usage Guidelines

This calculator is appropriate for:
- Quick everyday calculations
- Educational demonstrations
- Basic arithmetic practice

Not recommended for:
- Financial planning
- Engineering calculations
- Any safety-critical applications
- Academic testing environments

## Future Ethical Considerations

If expanding this project, I would:
1. Add more prominent disclaimer warnings
2. Implement additional accessibility features
3. Include educational tooltips about calculation limitations
4. Consider adding a "report issue" feature for mathematical errors

The complete ethical statement would be included in the project's README.md file on GitHub along with the license information to ensure users understand the intended use cases and limitations of this software.
